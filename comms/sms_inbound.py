"""SMS-gate.app inbound webhook helpers.

Pure functions for verifying HMAC signatures, extracting message fields from
permissive payload shapes, and formatting dispatch content. No I/O, no
FastAPI imports — keeps the unit tests fast and the route code thin.

Signature scheme: HMAC-SHA256 of `raw_body + timestamp_string` against the
shared secret, lowercase hex. Headers arrive as `X-Signature` and
`X-Timestamp` (unix seconds, string).

Payload extraction is permissive because the public docs are stale on the
`mms:downloaded` event shape — we accept the documented `sms:received`
fields too and fall back through plausible aliases.

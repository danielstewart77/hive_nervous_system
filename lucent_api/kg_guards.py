"""Knowledge graph write guards -- disambiguation and orphan node protection.

Provides two guards for graph_upsert:
1. Disambiguation: query-first check for duplicate/similar nodes before writing.
2. Orphan guard: reject writes without at least one edge (with grace period option).

Also includes Telegram notification for disambiguation messages.
